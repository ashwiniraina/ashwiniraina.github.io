Hello! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~mfreed/">Prof. Michael Freedman</a> in the <a href="https://sns.cs.princeton.edu">SNS Research Group</a>. My research interests are in storage systems, analytics and distributed systems. Before joining Princeton, I completed a master's at <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://indy.cs.illinois.edu">Prof. Indranil Gupta</a>. Before that, I worked in the industry building high-impact mobile computing systems.
